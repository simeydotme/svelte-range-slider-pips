# What can I contribute?

## ðŸŒŸ suggestions/requests for new features or changes

Please be sure to give a thorough explanation of what your suggestion is, and why/how you think it is useful. If you have a specific use case, any information about it, and links to it will be very helpful.

At the core, though, this is a component with a purpose. I will be the final judge of if the purpose is valid. Your adoption is your own perogative. You are free to fork and modify to suit your own needs.

## ðŸ›  pull-requests for bug fixes, or issue resolution

- â›” **Use [this REPL as a reduced test case](https://svelte.dev/playground/e29b748dade74d33a238eefab9a5ce72)** for any bug/issue submissions!

If there are any open issues, or you find a valid bug, please feel free to open a pull-request for review. I won't accept pull-requests for dependency updates, but those can be requested as an issue.

**Please stick to the code formatting and style already in place.**

When making changes/edits to the code you should use the `/tests/playwright` folder for testing all the functionality.

## ðŸ§ª filling in gaps in the test-suite

The test-suite is written in playwright, I've covered a large amount of the functionality, **but there are still some gaps**. Especially with edge cases, RTL Support, and interaction of different props with each other. _Any help to fill in some of these gaps would be greatly appreciated_. And
it would be a **_great way for a junior automation / QA engineer to get some open-source experience_**.
