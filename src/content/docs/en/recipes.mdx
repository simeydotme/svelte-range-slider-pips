Here are a bunch of pre-made recipes to help give you some ideas on what you 
can do with Svelte Range Slider Pips. 

I've provided some code snippets, and demos with the code and css needed to make
them work.

<Note title="Version 4" type="info">
  These recipes are all updated to work with the latest version of Svelte Range
  Slider Pips (`4.0.0`). If you're using an older version of the library, you can
  [find the recipes here](https://github.com/simeydotme/svelte-range-slider-pips/tree/3b44a9be7bfbc7ac37a970a82a2b3b1fadc3d302/src/components/Demos/recipes).
