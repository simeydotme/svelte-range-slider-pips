Here are a bunch of pre-made recipes to help give you some ideas on what you 
can do with Svelte Range Slider Pips. I'll provide some code snippets, and
demos with the code and css needed to make it work.


<RecipeList>
  <Recipe name="Color Picker UI" link="color-picker" image="color-ui" />
  <Recipe name="Daisy UI" link="daisy-ui" image="daisy-ui" />
  <Recipe name="Price Range" link="price-range" image="price-gradient" />
</RecipeList>
