Because the pips are all rendered, it's possible to style them in unique ways to
truly make the RangeSlider your own. 

## Pips

The pips are rendered in a `<div>` with the class `.rangePips`. Each individual 
pip is rendered as `<span>` with the class `pip` and a unique `[data-val]` attribute.


### Circles

Here's an example of a pip that is rendered as a circle. We are setting every
pip to be visible by passing `pipstep={1}` to the component. And after we have
rendered every pip as a small dot, we make every 5th pip a bigger dot.

<Demo name="Cute circular pips" client:visible>
  <Circles client:visible />
  <Code slot="svelte" code={cleanImport(CirclesRaw)} lang="svelte" />
  <Code slot="css" code={CirclesCss} lang="css" />
</Demo> 

<Note type="warning">
  This CSS is very performance intensive, and should be used with caution.
  It's especially laggy on Firefox. It seems the `+` sibling selector, and `:has()`
  are not very well optimized.
