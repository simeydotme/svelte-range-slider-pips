There's a few events which trigger at different times during the lifecycle of the RangeSlider.

<Event propName="start" propType="Function">

  <Code slot="example" code="on:start={(e) => { console.log(e.detail) }}" lang="svelte" />
  
  Event fired when the user begins interaction with the slider. This event fires as soon
  as the user mouse/touch down on the slider handle.

  <Code slot="detail" code="// e.detail
    activeHandle: Integer; 
    value: Float; 
    values: Array;" lang="typescript" />

</Event>

<Event propName="change" propType="Function">

  <Code slot="example" code="on:change={(e) => { console.log(e.detail) }}" lang="svelte" />
  
  Every time the value of the slider changes (either on a click, or by dragging the handle),
  this event will fire with the corresponding values. This event contains the `startValue`
  which is the value of the slider before the user started interacting, and the `previousValue`
  which is immediately previous value.  
  
  `previousValue` will be the same as `startValue` on the
  first change event, and using `previousValue` is useful for calculating which direction the
  user is dragging the handle.

  <Code slot="detail" code="// e.detail
    activeHandle: Integer; 
    startValue: Float; 
    previousValue: Float;
    value: Float; 
    values: Array;" lang="typescript" />

</Event>

<Event propName="stop" propType="Function">

  <Code slot="example" code="on:stop={(e) => { console.log(e.detail) }}" lang="svelte" />
  
  After the user has completed interacting (by releasing mouse/touch), this event will fire
  with the final values. This event also includes the `startValue` which is the value of the
  slider when the user first started interacting.

  <Code slot="detail" code="// e.detail
    activeHandle: Integer; 
    startValue: Float; 
    value: Float; 
    values: Array;" lang="typescript" />

</Event>
