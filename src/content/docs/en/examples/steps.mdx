Occasionally you may want to limit the interval of values that can be selected.
For example, maybe we are only allowing the user to to choose multiples of 10, but up
to a maximum of 100. This is where `step` can be used.

<Note title="Pips Placement" type="info">
  The `step` property interacts with the `pipstep` property. [Read more](/svelte-range-slider-pips/en/examples/steps-combined)
</Note>

## Basic Example

Here's an example where we're limiting the `values` that can be 
selected to multiples of `2.5` or `1000`.

<Demo name="Step at Multiples of 10" client:visible>
  <Steps client:visible />
  <Code slot="svelte" code={cleanImport(StepsRaw)} lang="svelte" />
</Demo>



## Clamping Values to Step

When `step` is supplied, the initial `values` of the Slider will be clamped to the
nearest value that is a multiple of `step`. This is to ensure that the `values`
are always valid.

<Info>The `max` value is always rendered and selectable, regardless 
  of whether it is a multiple of `step`. So try to make it a multiple if you
  want a nice looking Slider.</Info>

<Demo name="Step at Multiples of 10" client:visible>
  <Clamp client:visible />
  <Code slot="svelte" code={cleanImport(ClampRaw)} lang="svelte" />
</Demo>

<Note type="info">
  In this example above; the `values` that are put in to the Slider are not
  correct according to the `step` value. Therefore, the `values` are clamped.

  You can see that as the Slider initialises, the `values` change from `[-2,10]` to
  `[1,8]` as those are the closest values possible.
</Note>

<Note type="warning">
  Additionally, there is always a `last` pip that is selectable, which is aligned to
  the `max` value. In this case, the `max` value is `24`, so the last pip is `24`, even
  though it is not a multiple of `7`.
