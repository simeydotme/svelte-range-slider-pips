Because we have two ways of determining how `pips` are rendered along the
Slider, here's a breakdown of how they interact with each other.

- **`step`**: determines how many _**points are selectable**_ along the Slider
- **`pipstep`**:  determines how many _**points are visible**_ along the Slider

## Examples

Here's a table demonstrating how the two interact with each other.
