Because we have two ways of determining how `pips` are rendered along the
Slider, here's a breakdown of how they interact with each other.

- **`step`**: determines how many _**points are selectable**_ along the Slider.  
  <small><em>This is for interaction. Non-selectable pips are not rendered at all.</em></small>
- **`pipstep`**:  determines how many _**points are visible**_ along the Slider.  
  <small><em>This is visual, pips that are not shown are still rendered.</em></small>

---

`step` is multiplied by `pipstep` to determine the number of pips that are rendered. This can lead 
to some rather extreme numbers depending on the `min`, `max`, `step` and `pipstep` values. _See
the [Pip Steps](/svelte-range-slider-pips/en/examples/pip-steps) page for more details._

## Examples

Here's a table demonstrating how the two interact with each other.
