It is not always desirable to show every selectable value as a `pip` on the Slider, and so 
this option works much in the same way as `step`, but it only affects the rendering of the pips
and not which values can be selected.

<Note type="" title="Default Value">
  By default, if not explicitly set, the `pipstep` has two possible options based on the
  total range of values (`max - min`);

  - if `< 100`; then `pipstep` is set to `1` 
  - if `>= 100`; then `pipstep` is set to `⅟₂₀` 


  so for a Slider with `min={0}` and `max={100}` the `pipstep` would be `5`
</Note>

<Note title="Pips Placement" type="info">
  The `pipstep` property interacts with the `step` property. [Read more](./steps-combined)

## `pipstep` default
Here's some examples of the default `pipstep` in action.

<Demo name="Pipstep as a default" client:visible>
  <PipStepsDefault client:visible />
  <Code slot="svelte" code={cleanImport(PipStepsDefaultRaw)} lang="svelte" />
</Demo>
<Info>Note how the first Slider in this example has pips every 5 values, 
but the values in-between are still selectable.</Info>





## Explicity set
In this example we have explicitly set the `pipstep` to be `3`, so a `pip` will
be displayed every 3 values.

<Info>Notice how the ending of the Sliders have the pips kind of bunched up, this is because
the `pipstep` is set to `3` but the `max` props are not multiples of `3`.</Info>

<Demo name="Setting the pipstep manually" client:visible>
  <PipStepsExplicit client:visible />
  <Code slot="svelte" code={cleanImport(PipStepsExplicitRaw)} lang="svelte" />
</Demo>





## Extreme values &amp; Labels
Here we're demonstrating some very extreme `max` values that a Slider
may encounter. At this extreme it would be unwise and impossible to show a
pip for every value. So we use `pipstep` to limit the amount of pips shown.

You could imagine this setup for something like a Home selling website to
restrict the price range the user is looking to buy in.

<Demo name="Labels on Extreme Ranges" client:visible>
  <PipStepsExtreme client:visible />
  <Code slot="svelte" code={cleanImport(PipStepsExtremeRaw)} lang="svelte" />
</Demo>

<Note title="Performance" type="warning">
  It’d be quite bad for performance to display too many `pips`, as each one is an 
  individual DOM node. Additionally, there's only so many pixels on a screen, limiting
  the space for pips to exist in. 
  
  So it is suggested to use the `pipstep` feature to aesthetically limit the amount 
  of `pips` rendered to screen.
</Note>





## Special Styling
So far we've seen the use of `pipstep` to limit how many pips are rendered to the
slider. But sometimes we don't want to only choose to show/hide, but also how to style them
differently based on the `pip` position on the Slider.

Unique styling can be achieved with css, and the
css selector `nth-child()`. [See here for some examples](../styling/pip-step)





## Special Formatting
As evident with the _"extreme"_ Slider above, having large numbers such as "1000000"
rendered on the Slider is fairly unreadable. And sometimes we don't even want to show
numbers at all. We might want to display a currency symbol, or a percentage, or just
strings of text.

Special formatting of `labels` can be done using the `formatter()` property.
