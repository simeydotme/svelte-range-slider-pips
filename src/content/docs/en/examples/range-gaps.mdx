As of version `4.0.0`, it is now possible to set a minimum or maximum distance between the handles.
This is done by setting the `rangeGapMin` and `rangeGapMax` properties.

<Demo name="Range Gaps set" client:visible>
  <RangeGaps client:visible />
  <Code slot="svelte" code={cleanImport(RangeGapsRaw)} lang="svelte" />
</Demo>

<Note type="alert">
  Notice how the handles have an invisible constraint. One handle cannot be moved
  more than 50 from the other handle, and neither can come within 10 of each other.
</Note>


## Pushy (with gap)

The example above ***doesn't really feel good***. The user might need to move the handles
multiple times to get the range to the desired position.

So I would advise to almost always set the `pushy` property to `true` when using `rangeGapMin` or `rangeGapMax`.

<Demo name="Pushy with min/max gap" client:visible>
  <PushyGap client:visible />
  <Code slot="svelte" code={cleanImport(PushyGapRaw)} lang="svelte" />
</Demo>

<Note type="ok">
  In this example, when the min/max gap is reached, the handles will push/pull
  each other, allowing the user to move the handles to the desired position freely.
</Note>


## Fixed range gap

Another use-case may be to make a fixed-size range which can be moved along the slider,
but without allowing the user to change the size of the range.

To enable this we will also need to turn on `draggy` to allow user to drag the range, and
`pushy` to allow each handle to push/pull the other handle.

<Info>To make this example even nicer, there's a new `rangeFloat` property which allows 
combining the `float` values from both handles into a single float over the range.</Info>
