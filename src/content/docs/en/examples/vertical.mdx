RangeSlider also has the ability to render in a vertical orientation. This is done by 
setting the `vertical` property to `true`. When in vertical mode, the `min` value is at the bottom
and the `max` value is at the top. This can be changed [with the `reversed` property.](/svelte-range-slider-pips/en/examples/reversed)

<Demo name="Vertical Sliders" client:visible>
  <Vertical client:visible />
  <Code slot="svelte" code={cleanImport(VerticalRaw)} lang="svelte" />
</Demo>

<Note title="Boolean or not to Boolean">
  As is normal with Svelte, the `vertical` property can be explicity set `true`, or it can be
  any truthy value. This means that `vertical="yes"` or `vertical="1"` would also work.

  But idiomatically you should just use `vertical` or `vertical={true}`
