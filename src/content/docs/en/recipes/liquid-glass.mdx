import { Code } from 'astro/components';
import RangeSlider from 'svelte-range-slider-pips';
import { cleanImport } from '~lib/cleanImport.ts';

import Demo from '~components/Reusable/Demo.svelte';
import Note from '~components/Reusable/Note.astro';

Well, it's 2025 and Apple have seemingly decided to abandon usable UI in favor
of a Windows Vista-esque design language but without the opaque inner panels ðŸ˜². 

So I better get on the bandwagon and make a liquid glass slider!!! ðŸ˜°

Jokes aside, this is a fun demo of the slider component! 

Technically-speaking, there
is no 'liquid' effect here, because cross-browsers don't support the `backdrop-filter`,
`filter`, and `mask` properties simultaneously, they bug-out. <small>_(Also most of the liquid effects you
see are just a fractal noise displacement, not a real polar-coordinate liquid effect. I believe 
a real effect is only possible with `canvas` or `webgl` and even then I think the background has to
be simulated and not real-time)_.</small>

I've used some creative `backdrop-filter: blur(n)` and
`mask` properties to get a sort-of 'liquid' effect around the edges. By adding a psuedo-element
with a different blur-value--and masking it more than the handle--we then get two layers of blur
that work independently which gives the illusion of a liquid effect.

Adding on some creative `transforms` and `transitions` enhances the liquidey feeling.

  âš  ___DO NOT USE IN CUSTOMER-FACING PRODUCTION APPS___

  This is going to be **really bad** performance. It will probably 
  melt phone CPUs and drain batteries.

  <p><small>_Also, it's kind of completely unusable on very-bright, or very-dark backgrounds._</small></p>
