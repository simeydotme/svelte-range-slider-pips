This RangeSlider is built with accessibility in mind. **I've done my best to follow the guidelines
set out by the [**W3C**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/slider-multithumb/)** and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Slider_role). 
and have done some testing myself with VoiceOver on macOS and screen readers.

<Info>I am not a person with difficulties in accessibility, however, so I **can't really say with certainty** how well this
component works for people with impairments. But I have followed guidelines to the best I know. 
**If you are an accessible user, and would like to feedback, please do**!</Info>

I am aiming for this to be _THE_ accessible RangeSlider
component for the web, so if you have any feedback, please [open an issue](https://github.com/simeydotme/svelte-range-slider-pips/issues) or drop by the discussion
on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/simeydotme/svelte-range-slider-pips/discussions) and let me know! If you are able to contribute in any way to make this the
best it can be for people with impairments, I thank you so much!

## Keyboard support

  <RangeSlider id="a11y-slider" values={[-10,10]} range min={-50} max={50} pips all="label" pipstep={10} client:visible />
</Demo>

The RangeSlider supports the following keyboard shortcuts.  
_(use the slider above to test them out)_

## Aria Labels

It's possible to provide a list of labels for the handles to be read out by screen readers.
This is done by passing an array of strings to the `aria-labels` prop.

Read [more about `aria-label` here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label) , and
specifically for the [slider role here](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/slider-multithumb/examples/slider-multithumb/#rps_label).

Generally speaking, set the `ariaLabels` prop to a label **which describes the purpose of the handle**. For example, if the handle
is controlling the volume of a video, you might set the `aria-label` to "Volume".

eg; `ariaLabels={['Volume']}`
### `ariaLabels` example

<Demo name="Aria Label Example" client:visible>
  <RangeSlider ariaLabels={['Volume']} client:visible first="label" last="label" pips formatter={v => v === 0 ? 'Mute' : v} pipstep={10} />
  <Code slot="svelte" code={'<RangeSlider ariaLabels={["Volume"]} formatter={v => v === 0 ? `Mute` : v />'} lang="svelte" />
</Demo>

<Note type="info">
