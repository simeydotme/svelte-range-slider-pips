This RangeSlider is built with accessibility in mind. **I've done my best to follow the guidelines
set out by the [**W3C**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/slider-multithumb/)** and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Slider_role). 
and have done some testing myself with VoiceOver on macOS and screen readers.

<Info>I am not a person with difficulties in accessibility, however, so I **can't really say with certainty** how well this
component works for people with impairments. But I have followed guidelines to the best I know. 
**If you are an accessible user, and would like to feedback, please do**!</Info>

I am aiming for this to be _THE_ accessible RangeSlider
component for the web, so if you have any feedback, please [open an issue](https://github.com/simeydotme/svelte-range-slider-pips/issues) or drop by the discussion
on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/simeydotme/svelte-range-slider-pips/discussions) and let me know! If you are able to contribute in any way to make this the
best it can be for people with impairments, I thank you so much!

## Keyboard support



<Demo name="Keyboard Support Tester" client:visible>
  <RangeSlider id="a11y-slider" values={[-10,10]} range min={-20} max={20} pips all="label" pipstep={5} client:visible />
</Demo>

The RangeSlider supports the following keyboard shortcuts.  
_(use the slider above to test them out)_

- <kbd title="Tab key">Tab ⭲</kbd> Move focus to next handle
- <kbd title="Left arrow">Left ←</kbd> Decrease value by `1`
- <kbd title="Right arrow">Right →</kbd> Increase value by `1`
- <kbd title="Shift">Shift</kbd><kbd title="Left arrow">Left ←</kbd> Decrease value by 10%
- <kbd title="Shift">Shift</kbd><kbd title="Right arrow">Right →</kbd> Increase value by 10%
- <kbd title="Page Up">Page Up</kbd> Increase value by 10%
- <kbd title="Page Down">Page Dn</kbd> Decrease value by 10%
- <kbd title="Home">Home</kbd> Set value to `min`
- <kbd title="End">End</kbd> Set value to `max`


## Aria Labels

It's possible to provide a list of labels for the handles to be read out by screen readers.
This is done by passing an array of strings to the `aria-labels` prop.

Read [more about `aria-label` here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label) , and
specifically for the [slider role here](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/slider-multithumb/examples/slider-multithumb/#rps_label).

Generally speaking, set the `ariaLabels` prop to a label **which describes the purpose of the handle**. For example, if the handle
is controlling the volume of a video, you might set the `aria-label` to "Volume".

eg; `ariaLabels={['Volume']}`
### `ariaLabels` example

<Demo name="Aria Label Example" client:visible>
  <RangeSlider ariaLabels={['Volume']} client:visible />
  <Code slot="svelte" code={'<RangeSlider ariaLabels={["Volume"]} />'} lang="svelte" />
</Demo>

<Note type="info">
  (inspect element to see the aria-label, or use a screen reader)
