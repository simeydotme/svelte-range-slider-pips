# What can I contribute?

## 🌟 suggestions/requests for new features or changes

Please be sure to give a thorough explanation of what your suggestion is, and why/how you think it is useful. If you have a specific use case, any information about it, and links to it will be very helpful.

At the core, though, this is a component with a purpose. I will be the final judge of if the purpose is valid. Your adoption is your own perogative. You are free to fork and modify to suit your own needs.

## 🛠 pull-requests for bug fixes, or issue resolution

- ⛔ **Use [this REPL as a reduced test case](https://svelte.dev/repl/030797781fd64ad88302d1343f5b2c43)** for any bug/issue submissions!

If there are any open issues, or you find a valid bug, please feel free to open a pull-request for review. I won't accept pull-requests for dependency updates, but those can be requested as an issue.

**Please stick to the code formatting and style already in place.**

When making changes/edits to the code you should use the `/test/` folder and check the [README.md](test/README.md) in there to help with testing all the functionality.

## 🧪 help with creating a proper test-suite

I am considering how to add a test-suite as this component has a lot of different options and possible outcomes. I am not currently familiar with how to do this in Svelte, so any help/advice is appreciated.

**The main goal would be to make it super simple to setup and run / expand for anyone contributing, and I wouldn't accept if it seems obtuse.**
